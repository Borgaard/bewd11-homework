Final Project Proposal
I would like to make a personal Yelp for dishes, called, tentatively, Best Dishes. Iâ€™m a big foodie and use Yelp all the time, but going to a four-star-on-yelp restaurant can be a hit or miss depending on what dishes I get.

Jobs to be done:
- Best Dishes is a way for me to find the best pancakes in San Francisco (for example) to eat now or bookmark for later.
- Best Dishes is a way for me to give my opinion on what the best french toast in San Francisco is.

Technologies used:
Active record
     I will use Active Record and the SQLite database to store dish categories and individual dish entries (and their associated ratings, location, etc)
Web requests
     When a user adds a new dish, the app will make a POST request to the server to add a new dish entry
     When a user wants to see all the french toast dishes in San Francisco, the app will make a GET request to show all french toast dishes
Forms
    There will be forms to add categories of dishes (eggs benedict) and individual dish entries (buckwheat pancakes at Aperto) with ratings
Validations
     The forms will have validation for fields such as ratings (must be an integer between 1-10 inclusive)
Associations
     A category has_many individual dish listings
     A dish listing belongs_to a cateogry
JSON APIs
     When a user adds a new dish, there will be one field in the form for Restaurant, which will be a list from either the Yelp or Foursquare API

NOTE: I will likely have to scope this down once I start on the project, given time constraints of our class - it looks like we have 2 weeks left. I do want to build this out as I have it in my mind though, so will continue doing that even after the class ends.
