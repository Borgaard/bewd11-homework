BEWD11 Homework Repository
=============================

This is the repository where you'll push your homework each week.

How To Use This Repo
-----------------------

Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/my_projects``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```BEWD11-homework``` folder using your real name and github account name, like ```BEWD11-homework/NicoleBorgaard-Borgaard```. That will make it easier for us to remember who everyone's github name is. :)
4. For each homework make sure to put your files in a new `hw_x` directory in your named directory. Example for homework #3: `BEWD11-homework/NicoleBorgaard-Borgaard/hw_3/`

Example of what your folders should look something like:

```
|-- my_projects
    |-- bewd11-Arun
        |-- README.md
        |-- week1
    |-- bewd11-homework

        |-- YourName-github_username
