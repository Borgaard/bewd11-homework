BEWD11 Homework Repository
=============================

This is the repository where you'll push your homework each week.

How To Use This Repo
-----------------------

Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/my_projects``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```BEWD11-homework``` folder using your real name and github account name, like ```BEWD11-homework/NicoleBorgaard-Borgaard```. That will make it easier for us to remember who everyone's github name is. :)
4. For each homework make sure to put your files in a new `hw_x` directory in your named directory. Example for homework #3: `BEWD11-homework/NicoleBorgaard-Borgaard/hw_3/`

Example of what your folders should look something like:

```
~/projects/BEWD11-homework/NicoleBorgaard-Borgaard/hw_1/whatever_it_is.rb
```

Instructions
-------------

Only use this repository for your homework and any files you are contributing in class.

If any files are in the pull request outside of your personal folder, we will send it back to you to fix it!

Weekly Homework
----------------

**Submit homework by pushing to your bewd11-homework repo, then submit a pull request.**
